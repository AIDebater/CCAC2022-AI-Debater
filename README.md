# Intellegent-Argumentation-for-AI-Debater-CCAC2022

## INTRODUCTION

This year's intelligent argumentation evaluation competition contains 4 sub-tasks, covering argument extraction(**track1**), argument discovery(**track2**), interactive argument pair extraction(**track3**) and argument generation(**track4**). This year's competition provides data in both Chinese and English as evaluation corpus.

English Dataset (supporting **track 1** and **track 2**): The dataset is derived from the English Wikipedia, and is annotated by professional annotators for arguments, positions, arguments, etc., and organized into a formatted text file.

Chinese Dataset (Supporting **track 3** and **track 4**): The dataset is derived from nearly 700 well-known Chinese debate competitions from 2007 to 2021, and the single-link and unilateral statement text of each game is obtained through speech transliteration and manual verification, and the annotator has made the argument sentence and interactive argument equal labeling, and organized into a formatted text file.

We will provide four baseline models, one for each track. The baseline models for **track3** and **track4** are expected to be updated in early July.

We provide four datasets in this task, one for each track.
